# SirnoChan's Git Page

This is [SirnoChan](https://github.com/SirnoChan)'s personal site. Currently, I am working on these Repositories:

1. [SEOBlockList](https://github.com/SirnoChan/SEOBlockList): A list to record the blocked sites for Google Hit Hider by Domain in search engines results.
2. [LilyWhiteBot](https://github.com/SirnoChan/LilyWhiteBot): A JavaScript solution to cross-platform IM transfering, including IRC, Discord, QQ and Telegram.
3. [KumaScript](https://github.com/SirnoChan/kumascript): A project for MDN l10n and more.

 As you can see, SirnoChan is not familar with coding, but who knows what will happen?
